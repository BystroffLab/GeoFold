 MASKER is a fortan module for calculating solvent accessible surface (SAS)
 solvent excluded surface (SES) and solvation energy. See this publication for details:
 Bystroff C. (2002). MASKER: Improved solvent excluded molecular surface area 
 estimations using Boolean masks. Protein Eng 15, 959

 MASKER is open source. To get the current archived version, go to 
 http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/MASKER/downloads/masker.tgz

To install, unpack the package

 tar -zxvf masker.tgz

Change directories

 cd masker

And install the package using the makefile

 make clean
 make set4096
 make all
 make install

NOTE: you can use smaller masks by substitution one of the following for "set4096":
set128, set256, set512, set1024, or set2048
Look at this site to see images of a MASKER surface using the different mask sizes:
http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/~bystrc/MASKER/downloads/masker_install.html
The number is the number of bits in a mask, equal to the number of points on the template 
spherical mask. Higher resolution is better, but slower. The published results all used
4096-bit masks.

----------PDBMASK-----------
You can calculate the surface areas using

  pdbmask file.pdb

where file.pdb are the atoms in PDB format. Only ATOM and HETATM lines are used. All other lines are ignored.
or, if you want to see the surface as water-dots in a 10x scaled-up coordinate fie in PDB format, use

  pdbmask file.pdb  dots.pdb

Use RasMol to visualize the dots in "dots.pdb". Everything is scaled by 10 to keep RasMol from
drawing numerous bonds in wireframe mode.
The following RasMol script will higlight the surface types and re-entrant
water locations. The contact surface will be red, toroidal surface magenta, reentrant surface green,
centers of re-entrant surfaces (i.e. re-entrant waters) cyan, and contact edges yellow.

PdbMask also produces a "triangle" file for input to Raster3D prorgams (render) for
photo-realistic surfaces for publication. The output is unit 14 (usually fort.14).
This triangle file has no header for the time being. You can paste one in by looking at the 
Raster3D website. No guarantees on this feature. Let me know if it works for you.

Good luck!  

This package is (always) under construction. If you have questions, please contact me.

Please feel free to add to this package. If you make something useful, add it to the
"package" line in the Makefile, type "make package", then please send it to me!
